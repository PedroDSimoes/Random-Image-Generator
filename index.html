            <p id="Painting-Description">Leonardoâ€™s Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world. Today, it's housed at the Louvre 
            in Paris, France but it was created in Florence, Italy when Leonardo moved there to live from 1500-1508. Mona Lisa looks directly 
            out at us, the viewers, which was something unconventional for a portrait painting during that time. </p>
